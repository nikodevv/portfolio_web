					US-traded public companies' financial methodologies can vary based on industry, business model,

					<a class="text-center" href="https://github.com/nikodevv/quickData">quickData</a> is a python library which scrapes the Secruities Exchange Comission (SEC) 
					website for public filings and generates time-series data.
					quickData is able to create n:m mappings between different financial reports of any given
					publicly traded company and combine these filings into a single time-series.

					As an ongoing project, I intend to add a record of how quickData maps different filings 
					to one another so as to have lossless and dynamically reversible mappings. To my knowledge 
					(as an industry insider),
					none of the commercially available modelling tools used by hedge funds and banks are capable of serving 
					financial records without information loss due to consolidation. <!--This forces analysts to do a large amount of
					manual data entry. The data entry is time expensive, a source of errors, and distracts the
					analysts from things that matter while subjecting them to a mind numbingly boring task. With its
					(future) ability to reverse mappings, quickData will eliminate the need for manual data entry.   ADD WHEN NEXT PROJECT IS UP-->
