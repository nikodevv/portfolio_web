			<div class ="sub-body">
				<li class="list-unstyled">
					Dota 2 is a video game with a multi-million dollar professional scene. Before each
					game, teams draft Heroes from a common pool. The heroes chosen have a significant 
					impact on the strategic aspects of the game. If a team is caught off gaurd during a draft,
					it could cost them millions in potential earnings. Hence, there is a potential to add value to the
					scene by creating draft-time analytics tools.
					<br><br>
					I created a Dota 2 statistics database which stores professional match data.
					Although comparable databases and APIs exist, they tend to either constrict the number of results returned, or 
					take a long time to complete queries. These APIs are not geared to provide instant and complete results, which 
					makes them ineffective as the backend of draft-time analytics applications. 
					<br><br>
					In order to improve performance, the "Dota Stats" (name pending) database is not normalized, and data is stored is stored
					such that it can be returned with minimal post processing. This implies that many SQL conventions are violated. The primary
					cost incurred is that adding functionality to the API is likely to involve duplicating data and breaking the

					I was contracted to develop an interactive JavaScript module which calculated and graphed expected investment returns,
					dividend payments, and equity costs based on the current and dynamically changing market value of ETH/CAD.

					A small Peruvian airline contracted me to create and deploy a geolocation data mining script.

					The script makes API calls to onboard GPS systems and then plots the data via KML. The data can then be opened in 
					a variety of visualization tools including Google Earth.

					US-traded public companies' financial methodologies can vary based on industry, business model,
					geographic location, and company-specific preferences. Any particular company's financials
					can change significantly quarter to quarter, both in terms of account names, and statement
					structure.<br><br>
					<a class="text-center" href="https://github.com/nikodevv/quickData">quickData</a> is a python library which scrapes the Secruities Exchange Comission (SEC) 
					website for public filings and generates time-series data.
					quickData is able to create n:m mappings between different financial reports of any given
					publicly traded company and combine these filings into a single time-series.

				<li class="list-unstyled">
					As an ongoing project, I intend to add a record of how quickData maps different filings 
					to one another so as to have lossless and dynamically reversible mappings. To my knowledge 
					(as an industry insider),
					none of the commercially available modelling tools used by hedge funds and banks are capable of serving 
					financial records without information loss due to consolidation. <!--This forces analysts to do a large amount of
					manual data entry. The data entry is time expensive, a source of errors, and distracts the
					analysts from things that matter while subjecting them to a mind numbingly boring task. With its
					(future) ability to reverse mappings, quickData will eliminate the need for manual data entry.   ADD WHEN NEXT PROJECT IS UP-->
